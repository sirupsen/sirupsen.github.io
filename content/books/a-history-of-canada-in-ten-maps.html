<p>As a recent Canadian citizen, this was easily one of my favourite reads of 2020. Shoalts walks us through the history of Canada through 10 explorers who drew maps of what is today Canada. From the early Viking visits of northern Newfoundland, to Champlain, and Mackenzie (my personal favourite). I have something for these early explorer tales. Absolutely fascinating to read about these brave souls venturing deep into the unknown. Can't recommend this enough!</p>
