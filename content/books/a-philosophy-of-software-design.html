<p>This is a good compilation of lessons in building good software, likely many of which you've heard under other, idiosyncratic names in the occasional Hacker News post. The author's put names on a few things I watch out for, but never put a name to. Nothing remarkable, but an easy, nice read that's a good refresher for anyone who writes software.</p>
