<p>If I'd read this earlier in my readings about well-being and happiness, I probably would've given this more shine -- but unfortunately it struck me as somewhat trite. This is almost certainly wonderfully unfair, as this book was written in 2006 and based on its popularity likely a cornerstone book of positive psychology. Perhaps I could compare it to if you've read e.g. Farnam Street for years, and then read Thinking Fast and Slow -- it's just not going to be a very good book, because you've already spent considerable time thinking about the lessons of the book.</p>
