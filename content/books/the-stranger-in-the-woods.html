<p>In 1986 Chris Knight drove into the woods of Maine, left the car keys in the console, and didn't see another person for twenty-seven years. This book's a remarkable account of how he sustained himself, and a portrayal of the man behind it. I don't want to reveal much more, because it's a remarkable story -- if this has the least bit of intrigue, you'll find this account fascinating.</p>
