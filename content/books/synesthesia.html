<p>A collection of poems from a close friend. I can only rate it 5 stars because I feel like I know him even better now. The first poetry I've read since high school. I can't remember the name of this style of poetry, but he paints a picture and lets the reader interpret it. My favourite poems is when he allows himself to project more of his own emotions and thoughts into the picture.</p>
