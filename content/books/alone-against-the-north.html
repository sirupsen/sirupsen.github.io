<p>Adam identifies a river in James Bay, at the southern most point of Hudson Bay in Northern Canada that he can't find a single source describing in detail: Could he be the first to ever travel down this river? After several failed attempts identifying a travel partner who's equally fond of muskeg and mosquitos, he ventures into the depths of one of the most deserted places on earth alone. This man's risk tolerance is something else, but it makes for an absolutely exhilarating and inspiring read. If exploration is your jam, don't miss out on Adam's modern day exploration books. I'm now obsessed with this man</p>
