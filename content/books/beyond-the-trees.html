<p>This guy is nuts. Decides to portage 4,000km across Canada from somewhere in Yukon to Nunavut, from when the ice melts, to when it starts forming again. Needless to say, he has some epic encounters with wildlife, and this maniac paddles upriver against some of the harshest currents in the country. An absolute inspiration. What struck me the most is how he truly loves it -- when the guy decides to camp a few days out when he's just a few kilometres out, as he's dreading it coming to an end. If you've got any outdoor aspirations in you then you won't be able to put this one down.</p>
