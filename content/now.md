# Now

What I'm focusing on _now_. Inspired by [Sivers][sivers], with a slight twist
towards routine/focus. While we're at Sivers, highly pertinent to this page is:

> He taught me that “the standard pace is for chumps” — that the system is
> designed so anyone can keep up. If you’re more driven than most people, you
> can do way more than anyone expects. And this principle applies to all of
> life, not just school. [..] Ever since our five lessons, I’ve had no speed limit.
